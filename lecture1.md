Machine learning:
study of algorithms that improve their performance - p
at some task T
with experience E

well-defined learning task: <P,T,E>
example: playing Go
task - learn to move
performance - win
experience - study experts

example: learning to drive

Current examples: CV, Speech recognition, chess, irobot, etc

Many algorithms:
•Decision trees
•Deep neural networks
•Bayesian networks
•Hidden Markov models
•Gaussian mixture model
•Expectation maximization

Machine Learning Theory:
PAC Learning Theory (supervised concept learning)


other theories for:
    reinforcement skill learning
    semi-supervised learning
    active student querying
    ...
Also relating:
    VC dimension
    asymptotic performance
    computational demands
    convergence rate
    # of mistakes during learning
