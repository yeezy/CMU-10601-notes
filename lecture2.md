Decision tree learning:
    One example of funcation approximation

Function approximation
    Problem setting:
        set of possible instances X
        unknown target function f: X-> Y
        set of candidate hyptoheses H={h | h : X -> Y}
    
    Input:
        Training examples of unknown target function f that is y^i = f(x^i)
    Output:
        Hypothesis h H that best approximates target function f
